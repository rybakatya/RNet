# RNet

RNet is an engine agnostic lock free multithreaded reliable udp library designed for games. RNet uses native C sockets internally for minmized latency, zig zag encoding and float quantization for low bandwidth usage. RNet is blazing fast and makes uses of native memory to ensure no gc preassure from the library at all. RNet is easily extendable and made with simplicity in mind.
